						<p><em>Audrey Parks spoke with Estela Knott about the upcoming Cville Sabroso Latin Music & Culture Festival on September 16.</em></p>
						<p><b>First off, what is Cville Sabroso, how would you describe it, and what does it celebrate?</b></p>
						<p>Cville Sabroso is a Charlottesville’s Latin American music and folklore dance festival. It involves music, live music, dancing, food trucks from various countries of Mexico, Central South America, and the Islands. We celebrate it September 16th from 11-9:45 pm. There are a lot of people who are coming to participate this year and so we- the hours have grown. And it’s wonderful that so many people are wanting to participate from Latin America.</p>
						<p>It’s Hispanic Heritage Month, so that’s why we do it in September. So this year, see, we’re gonna have a tango group called Trucilio Tango. They’re in DC- the DC area, and they’re going to be coming to play and while they’re playing, live tango, the tango society of Charlottesville is going to be performing dances. We also have Tinqoi, which is a traditional Peruvian, Bolivian, Andean music who is going to be performing live music with the Centura Cultura Peruano, which is a cultural Peruvian center that has an array of wonderful dancers, young people dancing traditional dances of Peru.</p>
						<p>hey have kids as little as five and six years old up to adults dancing a lot of these traditional dances, and they came last year, and it was beautiful. We also have Radio Jarocho which is stationed in NYC and they are working with an amazing artist and teacher that we also work with, Venenza Ferino, and they bring their own dancers, and so all of the performances that we have involve live music and dancing. So Radio Jarocho is traditional Mexican Son Jarocho music, which is music- part of the music- that is the basis of our style of music for Lua. We mix a little bit of Son Jarocho, Cumbia from Colombia, and Cape Verdean music from Cabo Verde, and then Appalachian folk music as well. And so Radio Jarocho plays traditional Son Jarocho music from Vera Cruz, Mexico.</p>
						<p> We also have Orquedias de Colombia, Orquedias de Oro, the name of a group and they dance a variety of Colomban traditional dances, they have Capoeiras Esustencias, which is a Brazilian Capoeira, which is a martial arts slash dance and music tradition of Brazil, and they’re coming down from Richmond to dance and play for the festival.</p>
						<p>We also have a local group from Harrisonburg, Atrapado, which is a Mexican, they play a variety of Mexican music from the border, Mexican Cumbia, and Tejano like various styles of Mexican music, and then to close up our portion of the festival, is La Maquina de Salvador, which is a very well known band from El Salvador and known all over LA; they perform all over the globe. And we’re lucky enough to have them come and stop through our festival in Charlottesville and play for us from 6 to 7! So we’re really excited about that and they play traditional El Salvadorian Cumbia.</p>
						<p><b>Wow, well that is truly amazing! What a terrific representation, too.</b></p>
						<p>Yeah, and then we’ll have have food trucks from, let’s see, Mexico, Uruguay this year, from the islands. It’s just gonna be fabulous!</p>
						<p><b>Most definitely. So as far as location now, how does Charlottesville support this community-- how does Latin Culture in Cville play a part in shaping Cville Sabroso?</b></p>
						<p>Well, one of the goals of the festival, the main goal of the festival when we started it with Sin Barreras Cville, which is a local non profit who works directly with the local immigrant community, mostly spanish-speaking community. They and I really saw a need for wanting to help bridge the divide between the Latin American immigrant community and the rest of Charlottesville. Because everyone from LA who is arriving here in Charlottesville has such a rich cultural heritage that they bring with them. And we have the opportunity to influence local culture here, which is so important.</p>
						<p>There were lots of immigrants, you know, who came to Charlottesville in the past, and shaped the food that we make here and the traditions that we have. And that doesn’t just stop. That continues as new families and new people come from different countries and different parts of the world. And so, as far as Latin American culture, you know, there is a lot of rich cultural food and dance and music and art and literature and just so much poetry in every part of Latin America, from Mexico to Central and South America, to the islands, and we’re all very different. You know, all of these cultures are very different.</p>
						<p>And it’s really important for the Charlottesville community to get to get to know all the various cultures that are coming from Latin America so that people aren’t labeled just “Mexican”  because not everyone in Charlottesville is just Mexican. You know, we have people here from, you know, El Salvador, or from Guatemala, from Bolivia, from Brazil, from Argentina, from Peru. You know, from Panama, from Costa Rica. You know, these are all friends that I know, and I have met over the years, who are coming from these different countries.</p>
						<p>So, it’s an opportunity for us to express to Charlottesville and to introduce Charlottesville and to educate Charlottesville and the larger community about our traditions and also express to each other ‘hey, we’re all here together’ and we should celebrate together, and we’re all working hard, but on this one day we can all come together and we can celebrate. So that’s what I think it brings to Charlottesville, you know, and for the working part, if I can just mention this--</p>
						<p>The spanish speaking community, the the Latino community, they come here and they just start working. And they work hard. And we all work hard here in Charlottesville, but they work really really hard. And I feel like, everywhere I go, just because of my heritage, you know, I’m always looking. Who’s building our roads? Who’s taking care of our children? Who’s washing the dishes in the kitchen? Who’s serving at the bar, who’s cooking?</p>
						<p>I mean, all of these things, and everywhere I look, I see faces of people from all over Latin America, who are a part of the infrastructure of Charlottesville. Of making this community thrive. And so, that was what motivated me so much. I was like ‘we we need to have at least a day, a day to celebrate them.’ And I feel like it’s important for Charlottesville to celebrate what our friends from other parts of the world bring to our community.</p>
						<p><b>Most definitely- that’s a beautiful way to put that. So, Cville Sabroso will be happening on September 16th, which is fast upon us, which is very exciting. Where can people head to find out more about the lineup and more about the festival in general?</b></p>
						<p>Natalie, my friend, is working on that right now! So, we have, they can go to <a href="https://cvillesabroso.org/" target="_blank">cvillesabroso dot org</a> to check out the lineup for the festival. Yep, that’s the one! Cville, just the way we spell cville here in Charlottesville- C V I L L E and Sabroso is  S A B R O S O dot org.</p>
						<p><b>Alright, well thanks so much for agreeing to talk with me, Estela, it’s been wonderful.</b></p>
						<p>Thanks, Audrey</p>
